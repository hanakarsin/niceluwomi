Amber Portwood boyfriend Gary accused her of domestic violence, and later it was proved that she kept some large quantities of forbidden substances.</p><p class=align-left>After that, she had a long track of criminal activity, like substance abuse and domestic violence. She was charged with these and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sent to jail</a> for five years but was released early due to good behavior.</p><p class=align-left>However, in 2019, Amber from <i>Teen Mom</i> was charged with abuse once again when she hit her boyfriend Andrew Glennon. She was also charged with the possession of a deadly weapon. She was released after making bail but was given a restraining order against Glennon.</p><p class=align-left>Amber <i>Teen Mom</i> struggles with a few mental issues. In particular, she has BPD and bipolar disorder.

Later, they split, and Gary found a new wife named Kristina Anderson.</p><p class=align-left>After that, the teen mom had a few short-lived relationships, but her next serious one was with Matt Baier. Amber Portwood and Matt Baier were together for more than three years, and their union was not very healthy either, with their mutual accusations of abuse. They also split up a few times before getting back together.</p><p class=align-left>From 2017 to 2019, the star was in a relationship with Andrew Glennon. With this man, she became a mother for a second time.

There was a controversy about the female star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">threatening her boyfriend</a> with a machete and being violent towards him when their little son was near. Eventually, the two parted ways and got engaged in a custody battle with each other.</p><p class=align-left>In December 2019, reports came out that the former star had found a new boyfriend, a Belgian native called Dimitri Garcia. He was a fan of the <i>"Teen Mom"</i> show, and they met through social media. Fans hope that her new relationship will be less troublesome than the previous ones.</p><p class=align-left>Amber Portwood is one of the reality TV stars whose life story has been exposed to millions of viewers.
