What is his name? How old is he? Which superstars has he befriended? And, most importantly, is he just famous for his father’s money, or does he do something by himself? All of that you will know just in a while.</p><p class=align-left>The richest kid in Dubai name is Rashed Saif Belhasa, though the media refer to him as just Rashed Belhasa. His birthday is January the 5th, 2002, which means that he is only 16 years old. His star sign is Capricorn. Rashed Belhasa is of Emirati nationality and was born in Dubai to the wealthy parents. The father of Rashed, Saif Ahmed Belhasa and his mother Sarah Belhasa are one of the wealthiest families in the United Arab Emirates.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/927bdcacf8db8f60.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lil Baby net worth: how has the rapper earned all his riches?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Rashed won a huge lottery in life because when he was born, his parents were already very wealthy. The family owned a few luxurious residences all over the world, and he often traveled around the globe together with them, ever since he was a little boy.</p><p class=align-left>Rashed is not the only child in his family – he has the older brothers, Abdulla Saif and Mayed Saif. However, he is the most popular rich kid in his family. The reason of Rashed’s popularity is that despite his parents being incredibly wealthy and able to afford everything, he did not want to be famous just for their money. He decided to start making videos on YouTube, and this is how he gained his own fans, who watch and love his productions.</p><h2>The growth and development of Rashed Belhasa’s YouTube channel</h2><p class=align-left>Originally, the thing that inspired Rashed’s YouTube career was the sneakers. He once saw how much people liked the trendy limited edition sneakers of his older brother, and got influenced. He began ordering sneakers from all over the world, and eventually, he created his own sneakers collection, where he had many different types of these shoes. Rashed decided to show his collection on the Internet, and he posted a video, where he proudly showcased all the sneakers that he had.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/868b9d73e246e64d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Peter Ostrum, the former child star: where is he now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The video called “Legendary Sneakers Collection” was posted on November 3rd, 2015. At the time, Rashed was only 13 years old, and he did not expect his little video to gain such a huge popularity. The demonstration of his sneakers gained him about 4,000 new subscribers. In the next few days, the numbers blew up, and Rashed’s channel, which he named “Money Kicks”, reached the proud mark of 50,000 subscribers.</p><p class=align-left>Just a few weeks later, the young boy posted a video, which would later become a breakthrough and bring him even bigger popularity among the worldwide audiences. In this video, he was showing the famous rapper Young Thug his collection of sneakers. People were in total awe after watching young Rashed proudly demonstrating the collection to the rapper, and this is how his channel became super-popular, and the boy unexpectedly for himself became an internet sensation. In the next couple of months, Rashed’s fame came to him in larger quantities. A lot of media agencies and different channels on YouTube began talking about this young boy with the collection of sneakers, and all this advertisement gained him more viewers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/78ef2b12b461bdbd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Stitches rapper and his dramatic lifestyle</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Top 20 richest countries in Africa</p><p class=align-left>The influence of Rashed’s wealthy father helped him to attract many other celebrities and feature them in his videos.
