So, are Dove Cameron and Thomas Doherty still together? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Christopher Polk/Getty Images</span></figure><p>There are very few celebrity relationships that seem to make it for the long haul. We imagine the spotlight, pressure, and time away put a strain on the relationship. That's likely even more so for young couples who get together relatively young in life and in their career. Like, <a href=#>are Dove Cameron and Thomas Doherty still together</a>?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Dove Cameron and Thomas Doherty still together in 2020?</h2><p>The short answer is: No, Dove Cameron and Thomas Doherty are not still together. In December of 2020, Dove and Thomas' fans started to speculate that they had broken up, especially after it came to light that the two of them had unfollowed each other on Instagram. Both parties also deleted pictures of the two of them together. It wasn't looking good, but neither Dove nor Thomas commented on their relationship right away.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Finally, on Dec. 11, 2020, Dove confirmed the rumors with a tweet saying that she and Thomas had actually decided to part ways back in October. "The decision was incredibly difficult, but we still have love for each other and will remain friends," she wrote. "Thank you for allowing us our privacy in this time."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>hi all. In October, <a href=#>@thomasadoherty</a> and I decided to part ways. The decision was incredibly difficult, but we still have love for each other, and will remain friends. Thank you for allowing us our privacy in this time.</p>‚Äî Dove Cameron (@DoveCameron) <a href=#>December 12, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Dove Cameron and Thomas Doherty Meet?</h2><p>They met at work, and although Dove was engaged to someone else at the time, that relationship didn't work out. And that set the stage for these two to start one of the cutest relationships that has the support of both sets of fans ‚Äî which isn't easy to do.</p><p>In 2013, Dove was in a relationship with her Liv and Maddie co-star Ryan McCartan. Three years later, in April 2016, the Disney couple announced they were engaged to be married. They had dated in a pretty steady and solid relationship for the duration, which is why fans were surprised in October of that same year when things changed. Dove and Ryan announced they had ended their engagement, and it was over pretty quickly for them.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney</span></figure><p>That same year, in 2016, Dove and Thomas started working together. They were filming on the set of Descendants 2 in late 2016 and while no one is saying that feelings started developing between Dove and Thomas before she was technically single, the two became an item pretty quickly.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>„Ö§‚îó‚îÅ‚îÅ ‚ñå Dove Cameron x Thomas Doherty ‚ñå <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8ZcQgEZBDo</a></p>‚Äî leire ‚úß (@MestizaLectora) <a href=#>November 1, 2020</a></figure><p>By December of 2016, Dove and Thomas started igniting romance rumors that there was something there between the two of them, and really, they've been together ever since. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a>, Dove said that, at first, she was hesitant to acknowledge her feelings for Thomas, especially since it was so close to her engagement ending.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúI avoided him like the plague,‚Äù she said to E! News, though she knew that she was attracted to him right away. Thomas was the one who really made the first move though. He told her that he was falling in love with her, even though it had just been a few weeks since they had met.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dove Cameron and Thomas Doherty's relationship started out being long-distance.</h2><p>By February 2017, the pair were happy, though their relationship was long-distance for the most part. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Dove said that she and Thomas were taking things slow and keeping their romance to themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre dating. I‚Äôm keeping it sort of ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre keeping it to ourselves, because everything is just so more romantic and real when it‚Äôs yours and it‚Äôs private,‚Äù Dove said. ‚ÄúSo we are keeping the details to ourselves, but yeah, we‚Äôre dating.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>üí•it‚Äôs national tommy day !!!! happy birthday to my world !! the best human being to ever be created. the purest heart and the softest soul. i will love you forever</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>DOVE</a> (@dovecameron) on Apr 21, 2020 at 11:44pm PDT</p></figure><p>She said that though they were long-distance at that time, they made it work.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too bad, we are both working, and we are busy humans,‚Äù she explained at the time. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice.

Dove was even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">self-isolating with Thomas</a>, so no more long distance.&nbsp;She joked at the time that the two were doing what they could to make sure each person got the space that they needed.</p><p>Although Dove and Thomas ultimately decided to go their separate ways, it's clear that there was ‚Äî and probably still is ‚Äî a lot of love between the two of them. Breakups are never easy, but we're wishing them both the best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecOorZ5lk5a6pr7Op2SappRiwam7zJqqZpyfnbKzwNhmqq2hnKF6tbvGnquhnaI%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mai-mala-buni.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Read All The Latest News About Mai Mala Buni On Naija News">&larr;
