The two were part of an incredible saga that included Mutt’s divorce from renowned singer Shania Twain, Shania’s marriage to Marie-Anne’s ex-husband, and a broken friendship between Shania and Marie-Anne.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/e7efd182e94b2ff3.jpeg><p class=align-left>Mutt Lange and Marie-Anne hit the headlines some years back when their secret relationship marked the beginning of a <a href=#>series</a> of events involving betrayal, divorces, and new marriages.</p><h3>Who are Mutt Lange and Marie-Anne?</h3><p class=align-left>Robert John 'Mutt' Lange is a Zambian-born South African record producer and songwriter. Lange was born in November 1948 in Zambia but was raised in South Africa. He has mixed ethnicity from his German mother and South African father.</p><p class=align-left>Mutt was introduced to record production in his early years and has since worked with numerous artists including Britney Spears, Maroon 5, Bryan Adams, Michael Bolton, and Lady Gaga. <a href=#>His work</a> has earned him numerous Grammy Awards.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8e3344e1e248a62.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kevin Waire: List of Businesses Owned by Kenyan Musician Wyre</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Marie-Anne Thiébaud, on the other hand, was known by many as Shania Twain's best friend and long-time secretary. She was a close friend of the <a href=#>family</a> and worked as Shania's assistant. She managed <a href=#>the renowned</a> singer’s 46-room palace in Switzerland.</p><p class=align-left>Marie-Ann would also help with Shania's son whenever the country music star needed to travel. Other details of her background have remained undisclosed. The two also attended social events together.</p><h3>Mutt Lange and Shania Twain</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8e3344e1e248a62.jpeg><p class=align-left>Mutt reached out to Canadian songstress Shania after listening to her debut self-titled album, <i>Shania Twain</i> (1993). Lange was interested in co-writing and producing her music. They kept in touch through the phone and met six months after the initial contact.</p><p class=align-left>Shortly after meeting, Mutt and Shania got into a romantic relationship and tied the knot on December 28, 1993. In August 2001, the couple were blessed with a son named Eja (pronounced 'Asia').</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f8014a398094164d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Zari Hassan: List of Properties and Businesses Owned by Ugandan Socialite</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Mutt produced tracks from several of Shania’s albums, including <i>The Woman in Me</i> (1995), <i>Come on Over </i>(1997), and <i>Up </i>(2002). Shania and her husband also co-wrote some of the greatest country music love songs of all time.</p><p class=align-left>The couple was in a seemingly stable union until 2008 when things began to change. Shania's company spokesman announced on May 15 that Twain and Lange were going separate ways after Mutt had gotten into an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">extra-marital affair</a> with Twain's best friend, Marie-Anne Thiébaud. Robert Lange and Twain divorced officially on June 9, 2010.</p><h3>Marie-Anne Thiebaud's interview</h3><p class=align-left>When rumours of Lange’s affair began to surface, Marie-Anne appeared in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">an interview</a> with the People Magazine and vehemently denied the allegations. She asked the interviewer not to believe everything he heard in the press.</p><h3>Mutt Lange's affair</h3><p class=align-left>The secret relationship between Marie-Anne and Lange came as a shock to Shania, who faced double betrayal from both her spouse and her best friend. She first learnt the devastating news from Marie's husband, Frederick Thiébaud. Fred had discovered suspicious hotel receipts, phone bills, and a lingerie set in his wife's suitcase and later confirmed his worst fears.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/53cf190ba9156c11.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Eja Lange: All you should know about Shania Twain's son</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Fred confronted Marie-Anne and Mutt and asked them to tell Shania, which they did not. Finally, after several weeks, he informed Twain of the affair. The songbird admits to being in denial at first, even calling Marie-Anne to give her a chance to disclose the affair.</p><p class=align-left>However, this did not happen as she lied to Shania. She also asked Marie-Anne if she thought her husband was acting strange because he had recently asked her for a divorce. Marie-Anne was adamant about keeping her secret.</p><p class=align-left>The years that followed were painful for Shania, who suffered health issues due to heightened stress levels. She felt that she did not have the strength to love again. However, the famous singer found love and solace in Marie-Anne's ex-husband, Frederick.</p><p class=align-left>Shania says that Fred gave her the courage to love again and renewed her belief and commitment to love. The two tied the knot on January 1, 2011, in Rincón, Puerto Rico, and they have been travelling the <a href=#>world</a> together frequently.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b64bf982c19c6605.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shania Twain and Frédéric Thiébaud's relationship and children</span></p></a><h3>Is Mutt Lange married to Marie-Anne Thiébaud?</h3><p class=align-left>Is Marie-Ann Mutt Lange's current wife? Yes, after leaving their ex-partners, the two continued their relationship. Where are Mutt Lange and Marie-Anne Thiébaud now? <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The two</a> are allegedly still married and living together in Switzerland.</p><p class=align-left>They live low-profile lives and are barely seen in public. Coincidentally, Marie-Anne Frédéric Thiébaud and her husband live close to Shania’s Swiss residence.</p><p class=align-left>Here is a <a href=#>television interview</a> excerpt of Shania’s statement regarding Mutt Lange's partner.</p>She [Marie-Anne] is the last person on the planet I want to run into. Ever. I just wasn’t going to be pushed out. This is my home, this is my child’s birthplace and I’m not going anywhere.<p class=align-left>The story of Mutt Lange and Marie-Anne is perceived by many as bitter-sweet. The end of their previous unions opened up new seasons for them but marked the end of what was a delightful friendship. Nevertheless, fans will be on the lookout for what the future holds for these lovebirds.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/056aed0e13bc2a47.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Maria Aquinar: What you should know about Sebastian Bach's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Ralphie May: cause of death, family and net worth when he died</a></p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke recently published an article about the life of <a href=#>Ralphie May</a>.
