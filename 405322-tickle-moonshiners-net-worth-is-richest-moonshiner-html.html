The cast, who are the reason behind the show's success, has created immense wealth over time. Die-hard fans are probably wondering about the cast's wealth, like Tickle Moonshiner’s net worth. He is one of the most popular members that genuinely captures the show's essence.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/869217cdf4e7412e.jpeg><p class=align-left>Reality television shows expose fans to the lives of the cast that leads to numerous questions.

What is their worth, and most importantly, Tickle's wealth?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7d408cdf089310d8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Scott on Counting Cars?

He is the second original cast of the reality television show and has been part of it since the first season.</p><p class=align-left>A majority of his income comes from reality television. He is a restaurant owner and is as involved in carpentry. All these sources of income have created vast wealth for the reality television star.</p><h2>How much do the Moonshiners get paid per episode?</h2><p class=align-left>Even though Moonshiners depicts the classic narrative of a typical redneck, don't let the show fool you; they are earning a significant amount from the TV show. The actors live in the backwoods stretching from North Carolina to Virginia to Tennessee and are making money from their <i>illegally produced</i> shine. How much do they make per episode?</p><p class=align-left>They are paid an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">average</a> of $30,000 per episode. This a considerable amount that added to other businesses bring them a lot of income.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7f2d9b049b0b64d7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bling Empire cast net worth now: Who is the richest?</span></p></a><h2>Who is the richest Moonshiner?</h2><p class=align-left>All the Moonshiner cast make substantial amounts from the show. Even though Tickle Moonshiner’s net worth is significant, is he the wealthiest? Perhaps a look into the Moonshiners cast net worth would provide great insight.</p><p class=align-left>Tim Smith is one of the only two veterans in the reality television show and the original cast. He has an estimated <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $700,000. His wealth had stagnated at $140,000 since 2014, but considering his immense popularity and <a href=#>business</a> growth, it has likely increased significantly.</p><p class=align-left>The veteran, since 2013, has been trying to get into the legal liquor business that is gradually growing.</p><p class=align-left>Jeff Waldroup is also a significant member of the show and has been loyal since his debut. He has an estimated net worth of $400,000. However, the figure is based on his 2018 standing, and it might have increased or reduced slightly.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cc405dc5eeb87886.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Eugene Levy net worth 2021: How much does he make on Schitt's Creek?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Other members of the show including, Mark Ramsey, Eric <i>Digger </i>Manes, Josh Owens, Bill Canny, Chico, David Parker, and Jim Tom Hendrick, have a net worth of not more than $300,000.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, it is clear that Tickle is not the wealthiest person in the show, but one of the veterans, Tim Smith, is. He has created a great foundation that others are yet to structure, and that is why he has surpassed them with a significant amount. However, if things go well, others might create more money than him in the future and Tickle from Moonshiners is the most likely competitor.</p><h2>Is Tickle in jail?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7d408cdf089310d8.jpg><p class=align-left>There is a great probability that numerous people wonder why the Moonshiners are not in jail, considering they make <i>illegal </i>alcohol. They seem to get away with it all the time. However, <i>Discovery Channel</i> state before every episode, <i>Anyone making moonshine risk life-threatening injury or time in prison.</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6e104d6ff716f15b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Maine Cabin Masters cast net worth and salary per episode</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Many people were not surprised to hear that one of the stars, Steven Ray Tickle, was in jail. In 2019, Tickle stated:</p>After being locked up for a while, you get the feeling that you're all on your own. There is nobody else out there rooting for you. It plays on you mentally; it plays on you physically. In jail, you either laughing or you are crying. There is no in-between.<p class=align-left>What was the main reason for Tickle going to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">jail</a>? In one of Moonshiners' seasons, Tim visits Tickle, confirming he was in prison. The primary reason for him being there was never revealed, and it is not known whether it was Moonshine related. Many people have speculated that it probably had to do with him violating probation.</p><p class=align-left>In 2015, Tickle was arrested and charged for possessing a sawed-off shotgun. On top of that, he was driving with a suspended license. He was found guilty in 2016 and issued a three-year suspended penitentiary sentence.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bf30c22b232d4a0e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mountain Men cast salary and net worth: Who is the richest?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tickle Moonshiner’s net worth is an excellent testament to how reality television shows elevate people's wealth.
