The author is known for her books that feature harsh criticism of various politicians, including <a href=#>Bill Clinton</a>.</p><p>In addition to books, Ann notably pens essays and think pieces emphasizing her political ideology. She hasn't limited her work exclusively to editorial; Ann also dabbled in multi-media production, spending time as a news correspondent for MSNBC before making appearances on CNN and Fox. She also makes appearances in a few documentaries.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why do people hate Ann Coulter?</h2><p>The public's disdain for the commentator stems from her conservative viewpoints. She described herself to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guardian </a>as "just your typical, immodest-dressing, swarthy male-loving, friend-to-homosexuals, ultra-conservative."</p><p>In fact, Ann doesn't mind that people generally dislike her because her goal is to "stir up the pot." She told Cornell University's Chronicle Online that her goal is to not "pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do."</p><p>While Ann described herself as a "friend-to-homosexuals," her track record suggests otherwise. In fact, Ann consistently opposed same-sex marriage and Obergefell v. Hodges. In a contradictory statement, Ann said at the 2007 CPAC, "Well, you know, screw you! I'm not anti-gay. We're against gay marriage. I don't want gays to be discriminated against."</p><p>Moreover, Ann's anti-abortion position was met with a lot of criticism. She was in favor of the overturn of Roe v. Wade, but did concede that an exception should be made in the case of rape.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ann Coulter (@realanncoulter)</a></p></figure><p>She further upset women when she seemed to support taking voting rights away from women as a "solution" to her political disagreements with Democrats. "It's kind of a pipe dream, it's a personal fantasy of mine, but I don't think it's going to happen. And it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly, at least single women," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Observer</a> in 2007.</p><p>Ann was also accused of antisemitism after saying she believed that Jews needed to be converted to Christian on The Big Idea. "How many f---ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?" she tweeted during a 2015 Republican presidential primary debate.</p><p>Outside of direct political opinions, Ann made crude and offensive remarks about Chris Christie's weight during 2013's CPAC. At the same place, she made a rude comment about Sandra Fluke's hair.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ann Coulter (@realanncoulter)</a></p></figure><p>Additionally, the media guru was accused of plagiarism, leaving a nasty mark on her credibility and legacy. Writer Michael Chapman claimed that she ripped some passages directly from him.</p><p>While Ann identified as a Republican over the years, even those on the conservative side of the political spectrum have come to dislike her. She has frequently spoken against other conservative commentators. Plus, she publicly spoke out against former president Donald Trump, causing the MAGA conservatives to turn against her.</p><p>Hatred for Ann has caused the media to criticize and satirize her on multiple occasions and for social media to often attack her. While she has certainly built a base over the years, she's also made some enemies in much of the general public.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOoZKmdn6W5pnnHmqueZZGju26vzq6jrZ2i</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-did-fousey-get-banned-from-twitch.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fousey Just Got Banned from Twitch for the Second Time in a Month  What Happened?">&larr;
