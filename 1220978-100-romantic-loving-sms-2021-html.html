The components are:</p><li>It should communicate your feelings about your partner or what they mean to you.</li><li>It should describe the relationship or the bond you share. Bose explained:</li>You wouldn't just want to write a quote and make it so abstract that your partner is not being referred to; you are not being referred to; your love and your relationship are not being referred to.You are quoting something from the universe that has nothing to do with you. You cannot just say, 'Oh, see how bright the sun is, full stop.' If the sun is bright, what does that do with me? But if you say, 'See how the sun is so bright, and that's how you brighten my world,' you have connected me to the sun's brightness so that I can appreciate that.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/7fbfcde6df4d0427.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>33 fun games to play with your girlfriend on WhatsApp</span></p></a>You have to say something that describes your partner, what you share, what your partner means to you, or what their absence will do to you.<p class=align-left>3. It should be meaningful and allow your partner to see themselves in your words. She emphasized:</p>Before you say words, make sure that they are meaningful that your partner can practically see themselves in what you are saying or see a description of the union you guys share or something about you guys there. So when you are lifting things from the Internet, be careful.There may be a quote you like, but the quote probably refers to a broken heart, a shattered love, or a love that no longer exists. Just because you like it does not mean you should use it. If your partner interprets the meaning as something they don't like, it can cause issues.You don't want to send messages that have dual meanings. Make sure that what they say, even with a negative connotation, still represents what you guys are going through.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/229cf9f895d303c5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ love and trust messages for distance relationship for her and him</span></p></a>Even if you guys are going through a rough patch and you want to send something romantic, ensure it won't make your partner angry with you for saying something inappropriate. It has to be appropriate, and that's why you need to know who you are dealing with so that you don't just slam so-called 'romantic words' on them that'll tick them off on the wrong side.<h2 id=1220978-tailoring-romantic-messages-to-different-relationship-stages class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Tailoring romantic messages to different relationship stages</h2><p class=align-left>Bose also provides expert advice on how couples <a href=#>can</a> tailor romantic messages to suit different stages of their relationship, from the early days of courtship to long-term partnerships. The marriage coach emphasizes the importance of creating relatable and meaningful messages to the person you are addressing. She advises:</p>You want to use the words and expressions that describe us (the relationship). Don't just go to ChatGPT and say, 'ChatGPT, give me ten romantic expressions about dating.' Then ChatGPT does not know that you're an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ijebu man</a>. It brings all those romantic words that an American will use. It's now up to you to cultivate them. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6ef7d7351805b68d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>53 paragraphs for your crush to express how you feel about them</span></p></a>Let it reflect the person you are talking to. Don't be talking British expressions to me if I am an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ondo</a> woman. It's not going to be heavy. It's not going to carry meaning. And for goodness' sake, when discussing romantic expressions, you can write them in your language. It doesn't have to be in English.If you want to tell your partner, 'You're my sunshine,' both of you understand Yoruba very well and you know your partner can read Yoruba and write the Yoruba expression with all the marks on the letters. The person will first crack their head and wonder what this guy is writing. And then they read it and reread it. They will just be laughing, but that's the fun.<p class=align-left>By sharing insights from her marriage, Bose illustrates how couples can use romantic expressions to convey their feelings and emotions, noting that it is also essential to know who you are talking to and the expressions to use that will not be counterproductive. She said:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/9642b0e131c54f3a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ why I love you quotes to help you express your feelings</span></p></a>This year marks 25 years of marriage for us. Does that mean we cannot use romantic expressions? Even if we want to play romance like we just got married, who says you cannot If we want to talk about, 'Oh, now that we are older, I still feel the same way about you as when we were younger', or, like, 'It looks like you never changed', or 'It looks like, as you age, you get more beautiful.'Whatever you want to say, you can tell it. But make sure that it's relatable and you are not sending the wrong message to your partner—that your partner is wondering what the heck. Like, 'What are you trying to say? Are you trying to say that I am old?' You are trying to convey a message: 'As you age, I find you more attractive.' And your partner says, 'So you're telling me I'm getting old?'<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/ce0b3cc09b6bf89e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ emotional deep best friend paragraphs to show your appreciation</span></p></a><h3 id=1220978-true-love-messages-for-him class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>True love messages for him</h3><p class=align-left>He deserves to know he is your king or prince charming.
