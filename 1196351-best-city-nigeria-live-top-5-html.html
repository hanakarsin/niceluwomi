Let's try to figure out why it is so, learn interesting facts about the former capital of the country, and find out what other cities can be called the best.</p><p class=align-left>Lagos is located in the southwestern part of Nigeria. It is not only the former capital of the country but also its largest city. It is located on the coast of the Gulf of Benin and is washed by the waters of the Atlantic. Despite the lost capital status, this large metropolis still plays a vital role in the country, being an important transportation hub, as well as the economic and industrial center of Nigeria.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb4f6c5ad6886401.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 most developed states in Nigeria in 2019</span></p></a><h3>A brief history of Lagos</h3><p class=align-left>Initially, the territory of modern Lagos was inhabited by the Yoruba tribes, who called their settlement Eko.</p><p class=align-left>In the seventy-second year of the fifteenth century, a navigator from Portugal named Ruy de Sequeira set foot on African lands, and the first word that came to his mind was “lakes” - Lagos. So a new name was formed in the unknown area. From the fourth year of the eighteenth century, Lagos was the central region where the slave trade was widespread.</p><p class=align-left>Only in the early forties of the next century, slave trade was terminated. In the fourteenth year of the twentieth century, Lagos became a British protectorate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb4f6c5ad6886401.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Most important cities in Nigeria</p><p class=align-left>And now let's answer the main question, why is Lagos the best city in Nigeria to live in?</p><h3>Accommodation</h3><p class=align-left>The information that living in Lagos is too expensive is very exaggerated.
