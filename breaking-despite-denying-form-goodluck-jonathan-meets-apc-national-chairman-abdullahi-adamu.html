That was why the former president did not present himself to the APC National chairman on Sunday when the form was to be formally presented to him by the Almajiri who want to show him appreciation for what he did for them during his tenure by building schools and rehabilitating them,” the source said.</p><p>“The main argument of those opposed to Jonathan running on the APC ticket is that it would be belittling to his image and standing in the world for him to do so given where he had been and what he represents as a former president of Nigeria. But the point is that the deadline for picking the form is this week and if he does not accept the form, the window would be closed and the opportunity lost,” one source explained</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5BpZpuqlZa4qrrGZpueq6CewaZ5w56lsqGenHqnu9GmZKCnn5m5tq%2FKZqGoppGptaK6jKacnqyjYq6xr4ynmK2hn6OurXnCoZiiqp2Wu26twZ2spaSRnbZurcOapK5n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./randys-donut-movies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="In Honor Of National Donut Day: Randy's Donuts Appearances In Movies">&larr;
