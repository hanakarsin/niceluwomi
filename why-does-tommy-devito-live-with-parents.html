People would think that he owns a big mansion and is out living large, right?</p><p>But the professional athlete <a href=#>still lives at home</a> with his parents. Many sports fans and people in general want to know why. The reason is hilarious. Details ahead.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, why does Tommy DeVito live at home with his parents?</h2><p>He may like to take charge on the field, but <a href=#>New York Giants</a> quarterback Tommy DeVito prefers to be taken care of at home.</p><p>Yes, the superstar <a href=#>NFL</a> player still lives at home with his parents, despite earning a jaw-dropping $44,000 per week, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>.</p><p>The rookie told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a> that the decision to bunk up with his parents is "a no-brainer" for him.</p><p>"Everything that I need is there at the house," the winning QB said in November 2023 ahead of leading his team to victory against the <a href=#>Green Bay Packers</a> on Dec. 11.</p><p>"The decision was made since this level of football is stressful for a rookie, especially from the quarterback position," Tommy continued. "There is a lot going on, a lot of meetings. So everything outside of football is handled by <a href=#>my family</a>."</p><p>He went on to hilariously detail, "I don't have to worry about laundry, what I'm eating for dinner, chicken cutlets, and all that is waiting for me when I get there. My mom still makes my bed. Everything is handled for me. Honestly, I don't even know if I could find a place closer to here than where I live. It takes me 12 minutes to get here."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>ü§åüèºüáÆüáπüèàYou think Tommy DeVito got any left over chicken cutlets to celebrate the <a href=#>#NYGiants</a> win? Well, there WERE 300 cutlets at the DeVito Family Tailgate along with <a href=#>#TommyCutlets</a> t-shirts, beer & cookies. I caught up with his proud parents Alexandra & Tom, and his brother Max. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DogjqOwIfV</a></p>‚Äî Tina Cervasio (@TinaCervasio) <a href=#>December 12, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans love Tommy DeVito's obsession with chicken cutlets.</h2><p>Tommy has become known as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"the cutlet king"</a> to his many fans, who rooted him on when he took the top position and led the Giants to victory against the Green Bay Packers in a lead-up match to the 2023 playoffs.</p><p>In fact, at that particular tailgate, the DeVito family gave out chicken cutlets to fans who were pregaming near MetLife Stadium.</p><p>Meanwhile, as far as the new star's plans to move out, well, it seems he doesn't have any.</p><p>Tommy is in good company to be fair.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Statista</a>, as much as 12 percent of females aged 25 to 34 <a href=#>still live in their parents' homes</a>. In the same age range, 18 percent of males are enjoying mom's chicken cutlets, laundry service, and bed-making.</p><p>As for Tommy's counterparts on other NFL teams, well, they aren't getting the benefit of dinners from mom quite like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Tommy Cutlets."</a></p><p>For instance, Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes resides with <a href=#>his wife</a> and <a href=#>two kids</a> on an 8-acre compound in Missouri, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>.</p><p>But hey, no judgment! Tommy, you do you. Clearly, fans love you and you are killing it on the field this season.</p><p>Maybe the secret is those chicken cutlets!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlpKS6rsWMnZyvoaSkeq211Z5ksKGknXqxrdGepa2r</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jamie-lynn-spears-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jamie Lynn Spears - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
