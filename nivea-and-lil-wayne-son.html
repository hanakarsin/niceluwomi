Although their relationship ultimately did not last, fans have clamored for information regarding their past union and how it impacted their lives going forward.</p><p>This interview and Nivea's candor regarding her family have made plenty of fans curious about the extent of her and Wayne's relationship, as well as her previous relationships. So, what do we know about Nivea and Lil Wayne's son, and what other details have been shared regarding Nivea's personal life? Keep reading to find out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nivea and Lil Wayne share one son, Neal Carter, and she elaborated on how it all came to be.</h2><p>Nivea and Lil Wayne only share one child together, Neal Carter, who was born in 2009.</p><p>Nivea told Kandi that her relationship with Lil Wayne started with his saying, "I don't want to work with you, I just want your number," which later turned into "Come be with me, I got you."</p><p>Back on Oct. 14, 2009, the rapper broke the news to fans that he and Nivea, who was enjoying a successful music career of her own at the time, were expecting a son together. Come Nov. 30, 2009, Neal was born, but sadly his parents' relationship didn't last long after that.</p><p>The two artists broke up after being back together for just eight months, but any relationship tension that developed between them never affected their ability to co-parent Neal or how he was raised. In fact, Lil Wayne has worked since their split to always spend time with his son and guide him well, even bringing him out on stage on a few occasions as a young boy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by NiVEA (@thisisnivea)</a></p></figure><p>Neal has grown up with quite a large group of loved ones (three siblings on his father’s side and three on his mother’s side, to be exact), and the family seems to remain tight-knit and focused on maintaining healthy relationships with one another.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Nivea's other kids?
