I know a lot of that stems from the fact that I feel like I constantly need to entertain people and myself. It's a big, big problem I've been working on over the past few years.</p><p>So when I catch myself talking too much, I mentally step back, I ask the other person's thoughts on the matter, I find what's interesting in what they're saying and try to pursue what they want to talk about in the conversation instead of just yap, yap, yapping away like the gregarious fool that I am.</p><p>Because no one likes someone who just won't shut the heck up about utter nonsense that's mostly centered around themselves.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><p>I only really became aware of my problem after I was dumped by someone who mentioned that they never felt like I was actually listening to them during our conversations, which was a harsh, but hugely important wake-up call for me.</p><p>A wake-up call that this chatty house guest who goes by the name of Gary sounds like he is in dire need of after spending a couple of evenings with this woman and her husband, Will. She complained about Gary's inability to shut up in a since-removed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit r/relationships post</a>, asking people for advice.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><p>Thankfully, since nothing is ever really deleted off the internet, someone screencapped what she posted on Twitter.</p><p>And the story is hilariously insane.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Omg can't stop laughing at this absolutely boss-ass power move ðŸ˜‚ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/iwXm9zvDu4</a></p>â€” Booniss Everdrunk (@bookiesnacksize) <a href=#>June 20, 2018</a></figure><p>In the post, Reddit user tells the tale of Gary, who is set to stay with them for a week.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>She reveals that the first three days of Gary's visit has been a loquacious nightmare. Will's old college buddy won't stop talking and anytime they attempt to have a conversation about anything other than what Gary wants to talk about (himself), he just powers through and even goes so far as to talk over his hosts.</p><p>After suffering through his non-stop chatter for three entire days, she decided that she finally had enough over dinner.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>Calling Gary out on his behavior didn't help. Asking him to let her finish her conversation or respond with what she was talking about didn't help either, even when his old college pal asked him to stop being such a conversation hog. Gary just kept attempting to plow through and talk about whatever he wanted to talk about.</p><p>That's when our OP decided to take matters into her own hands and give Gary a taste of his own medicine. By not acknowledging him in any way, shape, or form, while taking his dinner entree from him and eating it silently.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>What's crazy to me is that Bri (OP), thinks that she was wrong for eating Gary's steak, which I don't think is the case at all. If everything she wrote about this guest is true, it sounds like showing him what it feels like to be completely disregarded is the only way to handle this situation.</p><p>It also helps that imagining the entire situation is just super hilarious.</p><p>People think Bri's move was absolutely perfect and totally justified.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>BRILLIANT.</p>â€” Tits McGee, BSc (Hons), MSc (@Scientits) <a href=#>June 20, 2018</a></figure><p>It's hard to find anyone who really feels sorry for Gary.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Omg she does not owe him an apology, he brought it on himself.</p>â€” The Awesome Aunty Fox â˜•ðŸ¦ŠðŸ“š (@FoxSpiritBooks) <a href=#>June 20, 2018</a></figure><p>Especially because we've all met one at some point in our lives.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I've known too many Garys to feel bad for him</p>â€” Booniss Everdrunk (@bookiesnacksize) <a href=#>June 20, 2018</a></figure><p>OP's story resulted in a bunch of excellent puns, too. So that's a plus.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Gary made a mis-steak!<br>For Gary, the steaks are high!<br>Will has a lot at steak in this story.</p><p>ðŸ˜‚</p><p>I'm sorry. I think I got the puns out of my system now.</p><p>But seriously. She should totes steer into this and eat all of Garys food. Wills too If he keeps being pissed off! ðŸ˜Ž</p>â€” Hisham (@HishamElfar) <a href=#>June 20, 2018</a></figure><p>Even though Bri deleted her Reddit post, it didn't stop people from throwing in their two cents about how she should react.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is so good. I would 100% not apologise, in fact I would pretend it hadnâ€™t happened. If Gary brought it up, Iâ€™d say â€˜what steak?â€™</p>â€” Tilly Latimer (@TilsLatimer) <a href=#>June 20, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I know your husband is angry but honest to god I would not apologize. He needed a serious come to Jesus meeting and you gave him one. AND you got a steak. If you do apologize tell him you're sorry you acted like him.</p>â€” Rachel Ward (@RachelWard) <a href=#>June 20, 2018</a></figure><p>Personally I don't think Will has the right to be angry. Sure, Gary is his friend and all, but honestly, Gary sounds like a real nightmare and he totally brought it all on himself.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKCloryze5FpaHFnYGt8c3yOam2na5KFfLDCxKujsmWTna61wNhmnq6do6k%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./peter-obis-presidential-ambition-appears-shaky-as-serious-crisis-hit-labour-party.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Peter Obi's Presidential Ambition Appears Shaky As Serious Crisis Hit Labour Party">&larr;
