He first came to prominence through his work as a senior development executive at MTV, where he helped bring Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County to air. He left MTV in 2007 to form his own production company and eventually produced The Hills and The City as well.</p><p>These days, Adam is the brain behind Netflix's hit series <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a> and many of its various spin-offs. Thanks to his incredible success as a reality TV producer, many are curious about exactly how much Adam is worth. Here's what we know about Adam DiVello's net worth.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What is Adam DiVello's net worth?</h2><p>Adam is reportedly worth an estimated $15 million, and he has earned that net worth in all the ways you might expect. By striking out on his own and landing on several incredibly successful reality TV series, he has proven to be one of the powerhouses of the genre in recent years. Selling Sunset is one of Netflix's biggest shows, and it's just the latest success story from Adam's long career.</p><p class="sc-bA-DUxO bSiVrH"><span>Adam DiVello</span></p><p class="sc-jVSHhB eSHvkk">Reality TV Producer</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $15 Million</p><p>Adam DiVello is a reality TV producer best known for his work on shows like Laguna Beach, The Hills, and Selling Sunset. He started the prominent part of his career as an executive at MTV, and then built his own production company so that he could produce shows like Selling Sunset and sells them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Adam DiVello's wife?</h2><p>Despite his success in selling the lives of other people for public display, Adam has managed to maintain a relatively secretive personal life. It seems like he is indeed married, but little is known about who his wife is.</p><p>When he appears in public, he does so with the women from his shows, and not with any romantic partner. Adam seems to relish the chance to have some relative privacy despite his high-profile shows.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Adam has faced abuse allegations from former castmates on his shows.</h2><p style=text-align:left>Although Adam has built some remarkably successful shows, he has also faced allegations of abuse from those who have worked with him.</p><p style=text-align:left>“There’s been complaints filed against him — multiple complaints … and it’s been sick,” Selling Sunset star Christine Quinn said during an appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast. “He actually told me to go fall on the stairs and kill myself at one point.”</p><p>“[I was] being too honest. That wasn’t the first complaint I filed against him," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christine added</a>. "There was another complaint — where he to this day cannot actually step foot on set with any of the women in the office because of misconduct. It was extremely terrifying when, you know, I mean, he’s screaming in my face. It was horrifying.”</p><p>As of now, Adam is still listed as a producer on Selling Sunset. It's unclear what the future may hold for him in light of these allegations, which seem to be serious.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrGiuYydoK%2BdnKG8brrErWSwp6KptQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./where-to-get-guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-popcorn-bucket.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where to Get 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' Popcorn Bucket">&larr;
