Nicole's long career in Hollywood speaks for itself, and her numerous accolades include an Academy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, one British Academy Film Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and five Golden Globe Awards.</p><p>Although it's clear Nicole is a powerhouse on her own, who is <a href=#>her husband</a>? And how many kids does she have? Read on for everything we know about Nicole Kidman's family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nicole Kidman has been married to her husband Keith Urban since 2006.</h2><p>Like many Hollywood relationships, Nicole was previously married. Nicole's ex-husband is action film star Tom Cruise, who she met on the set of Days of Thunder in 1989. The pair married on Christmas Day in 1990 and adopted two children together: Isabella Jane Cruise (born 1992) and Connor Antony Cruise (born 1995). On Feb. 5, 2001, a spokesperson for the couple reported to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that they had separated, with Tom filing for divorce two days later.</p><p>Although many rumors about the reason for Tom and Nicole's divorce stem from a difference in religion (Tom is a practicing Scientologist), their legally cited reason for divorce is "irreconcilable differences." The internet took delight in turning Nicole's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post-divorce paparazzi photos</a> into a meme years later.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Following her split from Tom Cruise, Nicole dated and was briefly engaged to musician Lenny Kravitz in 2003. In 2005, Nicole revealed she was in a relationship with New Zealand-Australian country singer Keith Urban, who she had met at G'Day LA. The pair were married in 2006 in Sydney, Australia.</p><p>Nicole admitted in a 2015 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Telegraph</a> that she and Keith "didn't really know each other" when they were first married, but added, "We got to know each other during our marriage."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nicole Kidman has a total of four children.</h2><p>Shortly after her marriage to Keith Urban, their first daughter, Sunday Rose Kidman Urban, was born in 2008. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recent interview</a> on Live with Kelly and Ryan, Nicole gushes about how supportive Keith was during her pregnancy. "When I was pregnant with Sunday, he got on a plane to fly to Australia to see the first ultrasound and was there for 6 hours, saw the heartbeat, and then had to fly back [to LA] to do a show."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Keith Urban (@keithurban)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>In 2010, Nicole and Keith welcomed their second daughter, Faith Margaret Kidman Urban, via surrogacy. Nicole has been very open about her love for children and even told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie Claire Australia</a> in August 2021, "I would've loved 10 kids. But that's okay because I get to mother other children. I have six nieces and nephews, and I'm godmother to 12. I love mothering [and] I love kids."</p><p>Many have been curious about the nature of Nicole's relationship with her adopted children. Public speculation that Nicole had grown apart from her children due to their involvement with Scientology was confirmed when Nicole said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a> in 2019, "They have made choices to be Scientologists. It’s our job as a parent to always offer unconditional love."</p><p>She added, "It’s not about anything else other than, ‘I’m here to love and support you.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7aku8ueZKShlKKur3nHrqqbmZ6Z</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./see-face-of-lagos-side-chic-who-drugged-and-stabbed-nigerian-billionaire-michael-usifo-ataga-to-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Face Of Lagos Side Chic Who Drugged And Stabbed Nigerian Billionaire, Michael Usifo Ataga To Dea">&larr;
