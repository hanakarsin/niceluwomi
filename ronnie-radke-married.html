While we can share that the controversial star isn't betrothed to anyone presently, he has been in a long-term relationship with another famous person. He previously dated someone else and has a child as well.</p><p>Read on to find out who he's with now, and about his past romantic status — and what he says about fatherhood.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ronnie Radke isn't married right now, but he has been dating a professional wrestler for a while.</h2><p>Ronnie is in a committed relationship with <a href=#>WWE</a> star Saraya Bevis, whom fans know as <a href=#>Paige</a>.</p><p>Some fans will recall that Paige appeared on the reality show <a href=#>Total Divas</a> starring the <a href=#>Bella twins</a>, Nikki and Brie.</p><p>Ronnie and the wrestler have been together since 2018.</p><p>They are pretty private about their relationship, but Paige once talked about a terrifying incident involving a stalker who came to their home and how Ronnie detained the individual.</p><p>"Scariest thing ever," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>. "He told us symbols led him to us. But Ronnie got him in a hold until police got there. [What] is wrong with people… thank God Ronnie is around to protect our house. Jesus.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Paige isn't the first person who Ronnie has been in a serious relationship with. He was previously engaged to another woman with whom he had a child.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ronnie Radke has a kid with Crissy Henderson.</h2><p>Before coupling up with Paige, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronnie was with model</a> Crissy Henderson.</p><p>They broke up in 2013 because the singer reportedly cheated on her. But before that, they welcomed a child, a daughter, together.</p><p>Not much is known about the child, other than that her name is Willow Grace Radke. Ronnie has said that becoming a father definitely changed his life.</p><p>“It's like night and day," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Loudwire</a> in 2013. "My life has totally changed. It's like, if someone cuts me off in traffic, I used to think about stopping and pulling them out of their car to deal with them. Now that I've got a kid, I totally re-think moments like that. There are a lot of things I can't do anymore and that's probably a good thing.”</p><p>Of course, Ronnie is well known for having anger management issues.</p><p>But perhaps being a dad has chilled him out somewhat? At least, this is what he is claiming!</p><p>Meanwhile, it isn't known how much Willow is in her famous dad's life today, or whether he plans to marry Paige or have more children. As far as anyone knows, Willow's mom Crissy is currently single. Details of their co-parenting situation are also not known to the public.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7yvusieZKuZlKCybrnAq6minZQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./transfer-bayern-munichs-deal-for-sadio-mane-revealed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bayern Munichs Deal For Sadio Mane Revealed">&larr;
