This is a continuation of the scam of the All Progressives Congress.</p><p>“According to statistics, a Nigerian household as at 2019 counted on an average of 5.06 members. So, with Tinubu’s uninspiring plan, each individual in a household will get ₦1,600 per month or N53 per day. What should they do with it? Use the money to buy sachet (pure) water or a cup of boiled groundnut on a daily basis? And this is the man they claim transformed the economy of Lagos State? This must be a joke or a more sinister attempt to divert public funds,” Shaibu submitted.</p><h2>Tinubu Is An Economic Illiterate</h2><p>Speaking further, Atiku’s aide said Tinubu lacked a clear economic policy apart from taxing Nigerians, saying the President has just been exposed as an economic illiterate.</p><p>Shaibu said Tinubu didn’t develop Lagos State but only benefited from the tax paid by corporate organizations which had been in the state for ages due to its status as a former capital city.</p><p>He said, “Tinubu boasted that he would ‘develop Nigeria’s economy’ like that of Lagos but this was all a scam. Statistics show that over 70% of Lagos revenue comes from income tax paid by private companies which had been in Lagos for decades due to its status as Nigeria’s former capital.</p><p>“His only plan is to tax Nigerians to death as he did in Lagos and that is why the people of Lagos rejected him in the last election. Tinubu promised to turn Nigeria’s economy into a $1 trillion economy but it is all a scam and can never be achieved with his brand of “agberonomics”.</p><p>Shaibu added that Tinubu ought to have focused on putting money into the agricultural sector and subsidizing production and working at attaining energy security that is the backbone of spurring desired economic growth from SMEs if he was really serious about reviving the economy.</p><p>He said, “Agriculture makes up about 30% of Nigeria’s GDP. He should have invested funds in the production aspect of agriculture and other issues affecting crop yields. The rural areas which are mostly agrarian are in the throes of insecurity. On Tinubu’s watch, over 200 people have so far been killed. However, he seems clueless on how to tackle this menace.</p><p>“The so-called palliatives that Tinubu seeks to share to the poor are just another avenue to divert public funds. For years, the Nigerian government has rejected calls to publish the list of the beneficiaries of the so-called palliatives but this has never been done because it is all a scam.</p><p>“Tinubu should stop trying to deceive Nigerians who are still suffering from the effect of his lackluster economic policies.”</p><h2>Vote Buying Technique</h2><p>Not done, Shaibu stated that the fuel subsidy removal palliative planned by the Tinubu government is another form of vote buying just like the Trader Moni during the past administration.</p><p>According to him, the palliative is just another means by the APC to divert public funds into private pockets.</p><p>He argued that, “Let no one make any mistakes about it, the planned palliative is Trader Moni 2.0. The scheme is nothing but a means to use public funds to prosecute political campaigns and objectives. It is even more telling that the current imposter government is contemplating the initiative when there is high expectation that the presidential election tribunal is set to give judgement in the controversial election that brought Tinubu into government.</p><p>“The APC is a political party that has lost favour with a vast majority of Nigeria, and it is no coincidence that since 2019 when the party invented the charade of Trader Moni, it also incontrovertibly introduced the menace of vote buying into Nigeria’s body politic.</p><p>“A special investigation into the Trader Moni initiative by the administration of former President Muhammadu Buhari revealed that more than N20bn was wasted on corruption, kickbacks, fraud and partisanship.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BsZpynnqm2r8HAraCopl2ks26%2FwpqkZpmknri2ecKapKllo6Gurr%2BMraCnrZKqerDCxKtkn62VoXq0wcGsoJ2xXaWurbjImquirpWofA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amotekun-arrests-15-over-death-of-police-inspector-in-ogun.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amotekun Arrests 15 Over Death Of Police Inspector in Ogun">&larr;
