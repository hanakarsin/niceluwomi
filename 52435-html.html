With the help of immigration office, Ogun State Command, the suspect and his family were assisted in procuring travelling document to Dubai without letting him know that he was being lured out of his hiding place. He was arrested thereafter at Idi-Iroko, Ogun State with two unregistered car he had purchased with part of the money.”</i></p><p>Also recovered from him were N656, 000 and $2,300, while Edward said he tore a N7m cheque belonging to the church for fear of being arrested while attempting to cash it.</p><p>Edward confessed to the crime while speaking with our correspondent, adding that he only stole N2.5m and that he purchased N1.8m cars from the loot.</p><p><strong><i>“I pushed my wife into the crime. My mother in-law was involved because she introduced me to the immigration officer that helped us procure the travelling document,” </i></strong>he said.</p><p>Fausat said she did not know that her husband had stolen the money.</p><p><i>“He threatened to leave me with the children if I did not follow him. So I followed him. He did not tell me that he stole money from the church,”</i> she said.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnOAkm5loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./maddie-brown-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maddie Brown and Caleb Brush Are Now Parents of Three!
