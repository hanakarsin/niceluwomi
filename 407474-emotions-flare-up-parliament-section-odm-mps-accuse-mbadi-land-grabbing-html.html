I want to say that there is no conflict around that area. The MP of Nyatike, comes from about 20kms to 25kms away from Utati. My home is 3kms to Utati. So he cannot claim that he knows what is happening in Utati more than I do," explained Mbadi.<p class=align-left>He claimed that the people of Karungu and Gwassi have lived harmoniously over the years.</p>"We intermarry and do other socio-economic activities together. Utati is where there is a cattle market and that cattle market is right inside my constituency and nobody can take it away. That land belongs to Gwassi and there is nothing to even investigate," he added.<p class=align-left>He rejected any plans by the committee to visit the disputed area with a view of investigating the cause of the conflict.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e386d266ccf76a24.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>President Samia Suluhu Sends Tanzania Ports Authority Boss on Compulsory Leave Over Graft Claims</span></p></a>"The committee has enough work to do not to go and look into issues that amount to ego. The Nyatike MP does not respect my constituency. There are no problems between Suba and Karungu people. If he is looking for votes then he should not use Utati to do so.
