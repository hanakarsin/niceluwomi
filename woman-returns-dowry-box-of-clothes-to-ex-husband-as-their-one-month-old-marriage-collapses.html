M. Dahiru, told the court that he was still in love with his wife and had no intention of divorcing her.</p><p>He, however, prayed the court to order his former wife to return the marriage suitcases filled with clothes he gave her as a gift.</p><p>Delivering his judgement at the court situated in Magajin Gari, Kaduna, on Monday, the judge, Malam Rilwanu Kyaudai, ordered Dahiru to return N100,000 dowry and the suitcases of clothes she received from her ex-husband.</p><p>He confirmed the divorce between the couple through Khul’i (divorce by mutual Agreement).</p><p>“She will only return the clothes she hasn’t used. The complainant has the permission of the court to move her belongings from her former husband’s house,” the judge ruled.</p><p>In another report, a chief man in Borno State was poisoned to death by his second wife of one year.</p><p>The victim, <strong>Goni Abbah</strong>, was said to have returned home from a prayer session at the mosque at Anguwan Doki, where he usually led other Muslim faithful in prayer, when the suspect, Fatima Abubakar, reportedly carried out the heinous act.</p><p>The State Command of the Nigeria Police Force confirmed in a statement made available to newsmen on Sunday that the 25-year-old housewife has been arrested and is now in its custody for further investigation, <strong>Naija News</strong> reports.</p><p>The state commissioner of police, <strong>Abdu Umar,</strong> while interacting with journalists at the force headquarters in the state, said Abubakar was arrested on October 19 by men of the Command at Anguwan Doki, <strong>Naija News</strong> reports.</p><p>According to her confessions, Umar said the suspect mixed poison in the Chief Imam’s food after returning from the mosque on the day of the incident. He explained that as soon as Goni started eating, his condition deteriorated.</p><p>According to him, the victim was immediately rushed to the State Specialist Hospital, where he was given emergency medical attention, but unfortunately, he later died when they returned home.</p><p>The police commissioner further disclosed that men from the Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department of the command were immediately deployed to arrest the suspect after the incident was reported by the victim’s family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5JqZrCnnZa7br7ErayrpqNisbDD0bJkm6eoYrynecKlpq2glah6tbuMnq9moKWor6K6w2aYrGWknbKqvoyopZ5lnaS7tbSMqKOdZZ2Wv7O1wKCcZpufobmivNKeqmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./2021-eid-el-kabir-fg-declares-public-holiday.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="2021 Eid-El-Kabir: FG Declares Public Holiday">&larr;
