He does not mean a word of it. He is offering a Greek gift. He is playing politics.</p><p>“Deep down he hates OBJ with a passion and he has always done because the President outfoxed and outpunched him at every turn when he attempted his treacherous move to usurp him and take his place as President.</p><p>“Some of us shall never forget that. A man brought you from nowhere and made you his Vice President and you tried to knife him in the back and take his position.</p><p>“You tried to disgrace and humiliate him and you coveted his seat. That sounds like Lucifer when he was in heaven to me.</p><p>“In the days of President Obasanjo, those of us that were in that government knew him as the pretender, the usurper, and the kingslayer.</p><p>“We called him those names because he tried his best to usurp the powers of the then President and he sought every opportunity to undermine, insult, discredit, humiliate and dishonor him.</p><p>“We thank God that each time he did so he failed. He tried his best to slay Obasanjo politically but God was with the President and he delivered him from his evil hand.</p><p>“It was so bad that on two separate occasions I was constrained to attempt to walk him out of cabinet meetings and I told him off in front of the entire cabinet and President, but each time Obasanjo saved him.</p><p>“Had it not been for OBJ’s kindness, merciful nature, and intervention the entire cabinet was ready to take my lead and walk out on him for his treachery.</p><p>“We just couldn’t bear it anymore. After I did it the second time he never came back to any cabinet meeting again. We were pleased with that. It’s the best thing he could have done.”</p><p>Fani-Kayode said the APC presidential candidate, <strong>Bola Tinubu</strong>, is not a betrayal and has never betrayed those that helped him to power unlike Atiku.</p><p>He added: “No matter what you say about Asiwaju Tinubu, he has never betrayed those that helped him to power.</p><p>“He is loyal to his own to a fault whilst Atiku does not know the meaning of the word.</p><p>“A man that is trying to give the impression that he was part and parcel of Obasanjo’s success as President when in actual fact he was trying to frustrate that government’s efforts to improve the lives of our people is nothing less than treacherous and deceitful and he cannot be trusted with power.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49vZqSdqZa6sHnRnpicrKNirrR5wK2gpK1dqLKmt9JmppuZo5a7q7vSZqCmmZeaerC6jKecsGWelrazrYynpq2dXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-nurse-joy-a-pokemon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pokmon Super Fan Theorizes That Officer Jenny and Nurse Joy Arent Humans">&larr;
