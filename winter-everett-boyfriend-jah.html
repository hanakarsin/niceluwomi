And now that they have their own spinoff called <a href=#>The Family Chantel</a>, we're getting an even more up close and personal look at their everyday lives.</p><p>The show documents how well everyone in the new family gets along (or rather doesn't get along). We get to see their lives unfold, including that of Chantel's sister, <a href=#>Winter Everett</a>. Season 3 of The Family Chantel takes a closer look at her relationship with her boyfriend, Jah. Jah didn't exactly hit it off with Winter's family right away — did he manage to turn things around?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TLC</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Winter Everett's boyfriend, Jah?</h2><p>We know that Jah and Winter met when she was 19 years old. Now that she is in her 20s, she's taken on the role of mom since he has a daughter. But thanks to Chantel and Karen Everett, Chantel and Winter's mom, we know more about Jah than he probably wanted to be public.</p><p>Winter's family confronts Jah in Season 3, Episode 2 of The Family Chantel. Having learned from a private investigator that Jah also has another child from a previous relationship, they decide to call him out on his lies. When Winter presses him, he refuses to give her a straight answer and won't talk about it on camera. Although Jah's sly behavior likely hurt Winter a great deal, she is still with him.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jah and Winter likely eat kosher because they are Nazarenes.</h2><p>In Season 3 of The Family Chantel, we see that Jah and Karen get into a heated exchange. "We follow a biblical diet," Jah says, talking about himself and Winter while the family is out at dinner.</p><p>After Chantel comments that she doesn't believe God sends anyone to hell for eating shrimp, the camera cuts to Jah, who says, "You eat a bottomfeeder, you think like a bottomfeeder."</p><p>Karen doesn't seem to like that. "Who are you saying thinks like a bottomfeeder?" she asks him. The trailer then cuts to Jah and Winter in a confessional where he says that going on a trip with the family was a "mistake."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Fans of 'The Family Chantel' have doubts about Jah's ability to adhere to the Nazarene values.</h2><p>Turns out, Jah likely refuses to eat shrimp because he is a Nazarene. Season 3, Episode 4, explores the family's reactions to Jah's religion in more detail. Not only are Karen and Chantel struggling to accept his beliefs, but they also criticize Winter's decision to try and convert.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>And Karen and Chantel are far from the only ones feeling skeptical about Jah's religious views. Some took to Twitter to point out that having a kid and consequently lying about it isn't strongly encouraged by the community either.</p><p>"Was Jah not Nazarene when he had his children?" tweeted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@CandeeKiara</a>.</p><p>"Here I am sitting through another episode of The Family Chantel and suddenly I’m learning that Jah is a Nazarene. As someone who grew up heavily engrossed in that religion, he’s just making up all these rules that aren’t part of the religion," tweeted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@staceynrockwell</a>.</p><p>Shellfish isn't kosher, which might explain why Jah isn't allowed to eat it, but there's no doubt there's still a lot going on there.</p><p>You can watch The Family Chantel on Mondays on TLC at 8 p.m. EST and on Discovery Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLavwMSrZJ6ulaeytcCMm6aynqKesq%2BwjKOYoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./breaking-ayu-step-aside-as-pdp-national-chairman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ayu Steps Aside As PDP Gets Acting National Chairman">&larr;
