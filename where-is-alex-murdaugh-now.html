Where is he now?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: ABC AJCL News</a></figure><p>The mystifying rise and fall of once-renowned attorney <a href=#>Alex Murdaugh and his family</a> has captured the nation's attention over the past few years. The former attorney's list of criminal charges involves everything from murder to drug addiction and theft.</p><p>Over a century ago, Alex's great-grandfather founded a law firm that employed dozens of lawyers in Hampton, S.C. Alex joined the firm as a staff attorney and went on to make partner before his world was completely shattered.</p><p>On June 7, 2021, Alex's wife, Maggie, and their youngest son, Paul were shot and killed at the family's sprawling estate in Hampton. No one was arrested for the heinous crime, which bought major scrutiny into every nook of Alex's life.</p><p>In the months that followed, Alex was reportedly shot by a former client. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo News</a> reported that the shooting was just an alleged ploy so his remaining son Buster Murdaugh would receive $10 million from his life insurance policy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: ABC WJCL News</a></figure><p>From there, Alex Murdaugh's controversies would continue to pile up. He was released from jail on $20,000 bail and was sent to rehab for his drug addiction. According to a 2021 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> report, he would later be arrested in connection to the mysterious death of his housekeeper Gloria Satterfield back in 2018. This combined with an investigation into his multimillion-dollar embezzlement allegations creates a veritable laundry list of criminal charges.</p><p>As of 2023, where is Alex Murdaugh now?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Alex Murdaugh now?</h2><p>In July 2022, Alex Murdaugh pleaded "not guilty" to the murder of his wife and youngest son, believing the killer to still be at large. His trial is now being brought to court in South Carolina, where he faces 30 years to life in prison without parole, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bustle</a>. His charges are also eligible for the death penalty, though it is unknown if that sentence is on the table as of this writing. He awaited his trial date in Richland County Jail on a $7 million bond.</p><p>Alex's trial officially began on Jan. 23 of this year, having kicked off with the jury selection process. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a> reports that he is being tried at the Colleton County Courthouse in Walterboro, S.C. He is currently being prosecuted for his murder charges, but it is unknown whether or not he will eventually stand trial for his other crimes in the future.</p><p>According to NPR, the trial is expected to last until Feb. 10.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>This weeks-long trial represents the end of an era for the Murdaugh family, who have served as prosecuting attorneys for coastal South Carolina for generations. Over the past few years, the long-established legacy of the family was publicly dismantled as more of Alex's crimes came to light. Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the state of the Murdaugh family has already been irrevocably altered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlkaGyuXnMrqmdmaWctW66zrA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./asuu-president-tackles-festus-keyamo-over-comment-on-strike.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ASUU President Tackles Festus Keyamo Over Comment On Strike">&larr;
