A large demographic of rioters used the opportunity to take photo ops, snap selfies of them flaunting government property, sitting on furniture, or <a href=#>causing damage</a> to the building, and they were smiling while doing it.</p><p>Two of the biggest examples of "they're not laughing now" from the riots are Adam Christian Johnson and Jake Angeli. Johnson, who was snapped grinning while walking off with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's lectern, was later apprehended in Florida. Angeli, who walked around shirtless in the capitol with a horned buffalo getup, is reportedly not eating while in custody because he doesn't have access to organic food.</p><p>There are tons of other folks who are being identified from photographs taken during the Capitol Riots, and many of these individuals have warrants out for their arrest and have been placed on no-fly lists.</p><p>It appears that the FBI is doggedly pursuing punishment against everyone involved in the riots and the Bureau is aggressively taking in any and all information that they can pertain to the rallies.</p><p>Including intel from people on dating apps.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Women in DC are reportedly changing their political stances on Bumble to Conservative to match with Trump supporters. They then begin to pretend to be intrigued by the Capitol Riots in the hopes of getting those who were involved to provide videos and photographs of them partaking in the violence. Then, these dating app users hand over the incriminating information to the FBI.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm changing my preferences from "liberal" to "conservative" on my dating apps and reporting anyone who brags about storming to capitol to the FBI. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5vwIC8Q4b2</a></p>— The Former President Known as Donald (@KatMeanJean) <a href=#>January 14, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Purely anecdotal, but I feel like I've noticed an uptick in conservative, gun enthusiastic guys on dating apps in DC.

The young woman says that she was kicked out of her home by her family multiple times for her being a "liberal lesbian" and noticed her mother's face in the riots. The story garnered national attention, mainly because people couldn't believe the irony in Helena's tweet.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hi this is the liberal lesbian of the family who has been kicked out multiple times for her views and for going to BLM protests to care what happens to me so:<br>Mom: Therese Duke<br>Uncle: Richard Lorenz<br>Aunt: Annie Lorenz <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cuBAPJ3GJA</a></p>— Helena Duke (@duke_helena) <a href=#>January 7, 2021</a></figure><p>Her mother urged her not to attend Black Lives Matter protests because they may become too violent, but then appeared to be involved in a violent altercation that involved the assault of a DC police officer.</p><p>Helena named three people in her tweet: her mother, Therese Duke, along with her aunt and uncle, Annie and Richard Lorenz.</p><p>While many people are getting off on the idea that the grinning Capitol Rioters who began a kerfuffle for about an hour and were quickly suppressed are now coming to face the repercussions of their actions, it's important to note that many individuals who "stormed" the Capitol entered with weapons, restraints, and committed violent acts. There's also a suspect who placed pipe bombs outside of the Republican and Democratic party headquarters near the Capitol in DC.</p><p>The FBI's offering a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$50,000 for information leading to this individual's arrest</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl8KursueZKimnJ67pnnDmquippdis6O1</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./312408-aliyekuwa-mbunge-wa-gatundu-kaskazini-clement-waibara-amkashifu-afisa-wa-trafiki-kwa-kumzaba-kofi-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aliyekuwa Mbunge wa Gatundu Kaskazini Clement Waibara amkashifu afisa wa trafiki kwa kumzaba kofi">&larr;
