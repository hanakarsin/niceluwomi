The populations in urban areas, especially cities, are continuously burgeoning to form the largest cities in Africa, while the once small towns are elevating their status to huge cities. One major characteristic of all cities and more so, the top cities in Africa is the challenge of overcrowding, as the rate of expansion can hardly accommodate the growing population.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/a88dc0f1afe5ecc0.jpeg><p class=align-left>The rapid increase in Africa’s cities in terms of their population is mainly catalysed by the need for a better life and the pursuit for greener pastures. As such, the increase presents both opportunities and challenges in nearly equal measure. Positively, population increase enhances the rapid growth of the now biggest cities in Africa through the availability of affordable labour and market for products. Negatively, the initially available resources are getting overstrained to accommodate the ballooning population, with tendencies of some people resorting to slums and street life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/17da66a8f47c1d75.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 richest cities in the world with the highest GDP in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Additionally, there is a continuous increase in the cost of living with products in urban centres getting more expensive, trying to balance the supply-demand curves. Most cities are however seeking measures and opportunities to not only respond to the changing population landscapes through devising novel ideas on food supply but also creating new housing mechanisms to ensure all city residents are appropriately housed and can comfortably access basic needs.</p><h2>Largest cities in Africa by population</h2><p class=align-left>As aforementioned, the rate of growth accrues both benefits and challenges. However, cities which have responded positively to the challenge of overpopulation are now reaping the benefits presented by the rise. As such, Africa hosts some of the fastest growing cities both in the continent and in the world. Here is a list of ten top cities in Africa to get you started.</p><h3>1. Lagos</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Country:</strong> Nigeria |<strong> Population:</strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">21 million</a></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9de85f0b28c7779f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 most developed cities in Africa to visit and live in 2024</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Lagos is one of the biggest cities in Africa, both by population and urban agglomeration.
