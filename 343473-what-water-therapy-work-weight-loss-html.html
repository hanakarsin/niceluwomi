Water makes up about three-quarters of the bodyâ€™s composition and plays a pivotal role in many bodily functions. Drinking lots of water not only aids to hydrate the body but also shed unwanted fat. That happens because water is the solvent that helps to bolster metabolism and absorption of minerals and vitamins. So, what is water therapy? Does it aid in weight loss?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/0fgjhs2hfl4ro5v0tg.jpeg><p class=align-left>Water also aids to flush out toxins that collect in the blood. That is crucial because it can help to ward off diseases among other benefits. But what is water therapy? How does it work? Can it help people lose weight? Here are the answers.</p><h2>What is water therapy?</h2><p class=align-left>Water therapy involves drinking at least one litre of water every morning you wake up. That means consuming the liquid prior to brushing teeth and taking breakfast. It also includes drinking water two hours after eating a meal. By practising Japanese water therapy, it can help to promote weight loss by cleansing the digestive system and helping in treating other health problems.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs3hiiib2bsktg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best bodybuilding foods to gain muscle</span></p></a><h2>How water therapy helps the body to lose weight</h2><p class=align-left>Water therapy can assist you in your bid to lose weight because of the following reasons.</p><h3>1. Burns calories</h3><p class=align-left>Drinking cold water in the morning helps the body to burn more calories throughout the day. You are likely to burn <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">up to seven calories</a> per glass of water you drink in the morning. That is because cold water stimulates a small thermogenic response. In other words, your body will work harder to try and warm back to its original state prior to drinking the cold water.</p><p class=align-left>Thus, the body will need more energy to regain its normal temperature. In that process, it will burn some calories, hence making you lose weight. Although seven calories are not significant, it can add up over a prolonged period.</p><p class=align-left>So, how much weight can you lose by drinking water for 3 days? You will not lose much weight in three days by drinking water alone. It will depend on how many glasses you consume throughout that period.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs66p2dnf6g97.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to reduce belly fat - effective tips for men and women</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> What are the benefits and side effects of drinking hot water?</p><p class=align-left>Assuming you are drinking ten glasses of water every day for three days, that equates to about 210 calories burned. If you do that in a year, you will lose about three kilograms or seven pounds of weight from drinking cold water in the morning daily.</p><h3>2. Reduces your appetite</h3><p class=align-left>It is the food you eat that contributes to weight gain. The more food you eat, the more calories you add and the more weight you gain. Drinking water in the morning prior to having a meal aids to reduce your appetite for food. When the belly is full, it will send a signal to the brain that you do not need to eat more. The water preload will increase fullness and satisfaction and decrease hunger.</p><p class=align-left>A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">study by Loughborough University</a> points out that a person that drinks at least two glasses of water before a meal consumes 22% less food than a person who does not drink any water. If you eat three meals a day, you should drink six glasses of water. The advantage is that the six glasses fall within the universal recommendations of water intake in healthy individuals per day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs3hiiib2bsktg.jpeg><p class=align-left>Since people are different, your needs will vary depending on your diet plan, activities, medication use, and general health. Also, water can empty your stomach quickly. So, for this to work, studies recommend that you drink water in the morning at least ten minutes before ingesting a meal.</p><h3>3. Reduces your liquid calorie intake</h3><p class=align-left>Food is not the only thing that will make you add weight. You can gain weight by accumulating liquid calories. That includes drinking sweetened tea or coffee, soda, and juice. Sports drinks and alcoholic beverages also have lots of calories that contribute to adding weight.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Is it good to eat a cucumber every day?</p><p class=align-left>One of the many water therapy benefits is that it aids you to replace high-calorie drinks every day. Rather than drinking juices and soda, you will consume more water and lose weight in the process.</p><p class=align-left>A previous study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that the replacement of caloric beverages, such as sodas and juices, with non-alcoholic beverages, such as water, may offer a simple strategy of promoting modest weight reduction.</p><h3>4. Helps burn excess fat</h3><p class=align-left>The body needs enough water to metabolise stored carbohydrates or fat properly. It does that through a process called lipolysis. Lipolysis is the breakdown of lipids and fats through hydrolysis to release fatty acids. Hydrolysis occurs when the bodyâ€™s water molecules interact with fats (triglycerides) to form fatty acids and glycerol.</p><p class=align-left>Technically, the idea of drinking water to lose weight fast is possible because the body needs water to burn off fat from foods and drinks, including stored fat. By increasing your water intake and staying hydrated, it will lead to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">increased lipolysis</a>. Fat loss can occur as a result.</p><h3>5. Make workouts easier</h3><p class=align-left>While drinking water alone can help you to lose weight, the number of pounds you are likely to shed may not be much in the short term. If you are thinking of drinking water to lose weight in a week, you should <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">also consider working out</a>. Many weight loss plans also include exercises. But how does water therapy help?</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>What causes cholera and how is it transmitted?</p><p class=align-left>Water aids the connective tissues, joints, and muscles to move well throughout a workout. It also aids the heart, lungs, and other body organs to function more effectively as they increase the level or amount of activity during a workout.</p><p class=align-left>By staying hydrated, you will reduce the risks of obstacles that can get in the way of a proper exercise. These may include things like fatigue and muscle cramps. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after a workout to prevent dehydration.</p><h2>How to do water therapy</h2><p class=align-left>The following steps will show you how to do water therapy for weight loss.</p><ul><li>Drink one litre of water immediately you wake up in the morning. That equates to consuming about 4-5 glasses of water on an empty stomach. Ensure the water is at room temperature. But you can also drink refrigerated water to increase the rate of metabolism.</li><li>Continue with your morning routine of brushing your teeth. You should avoid eating breakfast at least 30-40 minutes after drinking water.</li><li>To curb your appetite for food, drink water at least ten minutes before consuming food.</li><li>Do not drink or eat anything for at least two hours after having a meal of the day.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Understand that cold water therapy for weight loss may not be for everybody. That is because the body responds differently to specific changes. If you are an aged person seeking to shed off some pounds, do not drink one litre of water every morning. Instead, start with one to two glasses of water daily and increase the number gradually. The same case applies to those suffering from medical conditions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs66p2dnf6g97.jpeg><p class=align-left>Also, if you cannot drink one litre of water at a go, give yourself time between each glass. To get the best results, you should practice the Chinese water diet daily or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">incorporate it</a> into your day-to-day routine. Otherwise, the question of how much water to drink to lose weight in 3 days will not apply to you.</p><h2>Disadvantages of water therapy</h2><p class=align-left>As pointed out above, several studies suggest that drinking water early in the morning before taking breakfast can help you lose weight. But there is also a chance that over-consuming water can lead to specific problems. Here are some of the drinking water therapy disadvantages.</p><h3>Causes hyponatremia</h3><p class=align-left>Over-consumption of water can lead to low sodium count in the body. It will overwhelm the ability of the kidneys to excrete water. Since humans lose sodium by sweating, excessive intake of water during an exercise can dilute the concentration of sodium content in the blood.</p><h3>Causes headaches</h3><p class=align-left>A headache can be a sign of either dehydration or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">over-hydration</a>. Too much intake of water reduces the salt consumption in the blood. That can result in cells in body organs beginning to swell.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Jennifer Lawrence's weight loss routine and diet</p><h3>Causes muscle cramping and spasms</h3><p class=align-left>When you are practising hot water weight loss therapy, but you drink too much, electrolyte levels in your body drop. It will also compromise their balance. Low electrolyte levels may cause symptoms like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">muscle cramping</a> and spasms.</p><h3>Causes tiredness and fatigue</h3><p class=align-left>Too much water in the body can <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bring about tiredness and fatigue</a>. The work of the kidneys is to filter the water it receives and ensure the proper balancing of fluid levels in the bloodstream. But when you drink too much, the kidneys work harder. That creates a stressful reaction from the hormones, thus leaving the body and yourself tired and stressed.</p><p class=align-left>The rule of thumb when practising water therapy is to drink in moderation. Do not drink more than one litre at a go. If you are an aged person or ailing from a medical condition, limit your intake to only one glass each morning and increase the number gradually.</p><p class=align-left>Water therapy involves drinking 4-5 glasses of water each morning the moment you rise up. By doing so, it can help to promote weight loss because the water will suppress appetite and burn calories. By exercising water therapy daily, you can lose up to seven calories per glass you drink. Although the quota is small, it can add up in the long term and result in significant weight loss.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Does apple cider vinegar really aid you to lose weight?</p><p class=align-left><strong>DISCLAIMER: </strong>This article is intended for general informational purposes only and does not address individual circumstances.
